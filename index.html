          <h1>Hi there! I'm Elyse.</h1>
          <p>
            In 2018, I transitioned from a career in graphic design to web
            development. I haven't stopped coding since!
          </p>
          <p>
            I've worked in software engineering positions for coding bootcamps,
            marketing agencies, cybersecurity platforms, and web consultancies.
          </p>
          <p>
            These days, I'm looking for a new role and accepting freelance work
            to focus on empowering local small business owners and non-profit
            organizations.
